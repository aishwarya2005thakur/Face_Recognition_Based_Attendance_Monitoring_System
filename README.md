# Face_Recognition_Based_Attendance_Monitoring_System
The Face Recognition Based Attendance Monitoring System is an AI-powered solution designed to automate the attendance process using facial recognition technology. By capturing live video input through a camera, the system detects and identifies faces in real time, then marks attendance automatically with the personâ€™s name, date, and timestamp. This eliminates the need for manual attendance, reduces proxy issues, and ensures accurate and efficient record-keeping.
